## About The Project

This project aims to carry out a complete approach for several subjects that involve concepts related to data structure and its applications using the Rust programming language.

The importance of having a good base on data structure and the desire to learn to apply the main concepts using the Rust programming language were the main reasons that motivated me to start this project, therefore, interweaving with all the content that I've been studying I felt the need to create something that could both help me in my studies and serve as an aid to anyone who wants it.

All code developed will serve as a basis for your codes, exemplifying the applications of each one by removing the already compiled files, so you can implement each variation as you wish.
