In this guide we will present the main concepts aimed at studies involving data structures using the Rust programming language as a basis.

Every topic covered was written with a lot of dedication from all the collaborators, so if you have any modifications that you want to implement, just follow the steps presented on the home page to contribute (creating a fork, modifying and adding your modification with a pull request).

Written topics explaining certain concepts will be used, in addition to the applicability of each concept with specific codes to be shown and implemented.

Feel more than welcome to have a little fun in the repository and learn a little more about everything Rust and data structures has to offer!

## Why Rust?

It's cool. Just it. ðŸ¦€
