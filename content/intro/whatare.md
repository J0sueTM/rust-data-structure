# What are data structures?

Upon encountering programming, in its first contact it was possible to realize that the computer needs to interact in some way with us, making it necessary to write algorithms in order to make the computer literally compute something.

Every computation generates a result, which we can store and manipulate in data format. How this data is combined and organized depends on how it will be used for processing. There are several ways to organize these datasets, targeting each specific need.

The different ways of organizing data for a given task are called data structures, in which each basic structure has a set of operations for data manipulation, including insertion, deletion, search, sorting and ordering of data, making different structures can be organized aiming at a better performance.
