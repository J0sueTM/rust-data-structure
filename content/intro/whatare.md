# What are data structures?

Upon encountering programming, in its first contact it was possible to realize that the computer needs to interact in some way with us, making it necessary to write algorithms in order to make the computer literally compute something.

Every computation generates a result, which we can store and manipulate in data format. How this data is combined and organized depends on how it will be used for processing. There are several ways to organize these datasets, targeting each specific need.

The different ways of organizing data for a given task are called data structures, in which each basic structure has a set of operations for data manipulation, including insertion, deletion, search, sorting and ordering of data, making different structures can be organized aiming at a better performance.

## Characteristics

The structures basically can be linear or non-linear, homogeneous or heterogeneous and static or dynamic.

### Linear x Non-linear

The data are stored linearly in linear structures, in order to form a kind of lines - specific queues - for organizing this data. For non-linear structures, we have graphs as a clear example, which use other means of organization (which we will go into later).

### Homogeneous x Heterogeneous

Here we have a difference in the types of data that can be stored in each node (a concept to be developed later). When we have data of the same type being manipulated we are dealing with a homogeneous structure, while data of different types form a heterogeneous structure.

### Static x Dynamic

The amount of memory to be used is a factor that determines whether a data structure is static or dynamic, in which static structures have a fixed memory capacity always, while dynamic ones can expand and be easily manipulated.

For recommendation of books to be studied about data structures I recommend [this publication](https://medium.com/javarevisited/10-best-books-for-data-structure-and-algorithms-for-beginners-in-java-c-c-and-python-5e3d9b478eb1) that shows a little about each of the main books.

Let's see a little about some types of data structures?
