# Stack

Stack is a memory space that is used for allocating primitive types of temporary information. The reservation of the amount of memory needed for such a function is generated from calculations made by the Rust compiler itself, this storage space already has its own dynamic size due to the dependence of its demand, however, it is up to the program to add or remove elements within it.
